We are saving you time, money, and giving you the convenience in answering your questions on your time.  No awkward phone calls, no stress in searching for doctors and not knowing who to visit, and no need paying co-payments just to be put in the right direction.  We are here to guide you in the right direction of getting better.

		Learning HTML for Building Websites
		</h5>
		<p>
		Here's a few notes that I'm taking about HTML.  These symbols "< >" are called Tags in HTML.  You can think of tags as being like parentheses: whenever you open one, you should close it. Tags also nest, so you should close them in the right order: the most recently opened tag should be the first one closed.
